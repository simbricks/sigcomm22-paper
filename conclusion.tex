\section{Conclusion}

We described and evaluated \sysname, a novel modular framework
enabling full end-to-end simulation of network systems by combining
multiple tried-and-true simulators for different system components.
%
\sysname is fast and scalable, and accurately and deterministically
connects and synchronizes simulators.
%
We also demonstrated \sysname can replicate key findings from prior
work, including congestion control, in-network compute, and NIC
hardware architecture.
%
End-to-end simulations are a valuable tool for systems research,
especially in the era of specialized hardware.
