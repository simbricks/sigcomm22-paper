# SimBricks SIGCOMM'2022 Paper Repository

This repository contains the latex source for our paper *SimBricks: End-to-End
Network System Evaluation with Modular Simulation* in SIGCOMM'22. This includes
all latex source, figures, and graphs, as well as a Makefile for building
everything.

We provide a compiled version [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14219), and
after SIGCOMM'22 an official open-access version will be available through the
ACM digital library.

You can find more information about SimBricks on our
[website](https://simbricks.github.io/) or in our
[main GitHub repository](https://github.com/simbricks/simbricks).

Most of the raw data and scripts to reproduce our results are available in our
[artifact repository](https://github.com/simbricks/sigcomm22-artifact).
